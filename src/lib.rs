//! A collection of nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms.
//!
//! # Terminology
//!
//! For unifying the terms, in this documentation,
//!
//! + "Iteration" is called "generation".
//! + "Function" that evaluates value is called "objective function".
//! + "Return value" of the objective function is called "fitness".
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! There are two traits [`Algorithm`] and [`Setting`].
//! The previous is used to design the optimization method,
//! and the latter is the setting interface.
//!
//! [`Solver`] is a simple interface for obtaining the solution, or analyzing
//! the result. This type allows you to use the pre-defined methods without
//! importing any traits.
//!
//! All provided methods are listed in the module [`methods`].
//!
//! For making your owned method, please see [`utility::prelude`].
//!
//! # Objective Function
//!
//! For a quick demo with callable object, please see [`Fx`].
//!
//! You can define your question as an objective function through implementing
//! [`ObjFunc`], and then the upper bound, lower bound, and an objective
//! function [`ObjFunc::fitness()`] returns [`utility::Fitness`] should be
//! defined.
//!
//! # Random Function
//!
//! This crate uses a 64bit ChaCha algorithm ([`random::Rng`]) to generate
//! uniform random values. Before that, a random seed is required. The seed is
//! generated by `getrandom` crate, please see its support platform.
//!
//! In parallelization, the random number is **unstable** because of the dynamic
//! planning of the rayon library. Fix the seed and change the thread to one via
//! to obtain a determined result. Please see `crate::rayon::single_thread` when
//! enabled `rayon` feature.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! + `std`: Default feature. Enable standard library function, such as timing
//! and threading. If `std` is disabled, crate "libm" will be enabled for the
//! math functions.
//! + `rayon`: Enable parallel computation via `rayon`, let objective function
//! running without ordered. Disable it for the platform that doesn't supported
//! threading, or if your objective function is not complicate enough. This
//! feature require `std` feature.
//! + `clap`: Add CLI argument support for the provided algorithms and their
//! options.
//!
//! # Compatibility
//!
//! If you are using this crate for providing objective function,
//! other downstream crates of yours may have some problems with compatibility.
//!
//! The most important thing is using a stable version, specifying the major
//! version number. Then re-export (`pub use`) this crate for the downstream
//! crates.
//!
//! This crate does the same things on `ndarray` and `rayon`.
